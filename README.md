## Description
> The project features creation, analysis, and conclusion of three Deep Neural Network (DNN) Machine Learning techniques: MLClassifier with sklearn, DNNClassifier with TensorFlow, and DNNRegressor with TensorFlow.  The three models/techniques are analysed to see which performs the best and worst.  The project was created for the purpose of a capstone project with Udacity's "Data Science Nano-Degree" course. 

## Features
- website article on project: https://medium.com/@caleb.r.manske/this-will-make-you-think-twice-on-putting-money-in-a-machine-learning-model-27ef5f3ed799
- file: data_ML = raw data in cleaned form
- file: Project Part I, analysis and prep.ipynb = prep of raw data
- file: Project Part II, DNN ML and output.ipynb = use of raw data prep to make models and analysis

## Installation
To preform operations certain packages are required:
- python 3, sklearn, pylab, pandas, numpy, datetime, tensorflow == 1.3 (not 2.0), yfinance, pandas-datareader

### Setup
- make sure to "$ pip3 install yfinance":
```javascript
$ pip3 install yfinance
```
- make sure to "$ pip3 install pandas-datareader":
```javascript
$ pip3 install pandas-datareader
```
- make sure to "$ pip install --user install tensorflow==1.3.0":
```javascript
$ $ pip install --user install tensorflow==1.3.0
```
- if working on your own computer with jupyter notebook, a "virtualenv" may need to be created for TensorFlow to work
